# XYplus
It makes temporal XY graphs using matplotlib.

How the program works.

Data must be stored in a DB accessed through pyodbc.
An xml file controls "projects", where the information about how the graphs are stored.
Run options are stored in the module XYplus_parametres, through several variables.
